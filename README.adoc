My collection of little EE helpers that I use over and over.

=== Pre-Requisites

If you want to use my Authenticator, you must pick one and provide a dummy subclass
of it with the name "Authenticator", as shown here.

[source,"java"]
----
import javax.inject.Named;

@Named("Authenticator")
public class MyAuthenticator extends AuthenticatorJPA {
	// Empty class, just to hold the @Named on a subclass
}
----

=== Classes

Authenticator
AuthenticatorJPA
AuthenticatorCMS

EntityHome - a subset of Seam2 EntityHome.

EntityList is NOT provided; use Apache DeltaSpike Data for that!

Person - a loginnable person, for the Authenticator.
